### Why I want to learn this invaluable skill
![](https://i.imgur.com/k1n6waH.jpg?1)


I am currently studying software engineering for a multitude of reasons. Currently the number one reason is to finally have stability in my life, to finally not live paycheck to paycheck and to finally feel accomplished.

The other reason is to work towards my main goal of becoming a Bio-Mechanical Engineer. Ever since I was a child ive dreamed of robotics, more specifically giving those who have lost limb and purpose a chance again. Sadly, as I got older I started to toss that dream aside. However, due to past experiences i realize how foolish it was to give up so easily on something i felt passion for.

My personal goal is to secure my future and work my way towards becoming a Bio-Mechanical Engineer, my first step is learning how to code and work my way up in the industry.
