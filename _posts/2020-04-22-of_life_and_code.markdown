When I was a kid I always asked "why?". Many mistunderstood this as me being either dumb, annoying or simply not hearing what was asked of me. The simple truth, however, was that I just wanted to understand everything to its core. Even the simple things, "why is it we can see?", "why do we need to eat vegetables?", "why is the sky blue?" as well as other questions many would consider trivial. When it comes to coding I dont think I've ever asked "why" more in my life, young me would be impressed. Be it me actually curious as to how x relates to y or out of frustration, coding something I've coded a dozen times prior just for it not to work this time. Today, I want to talk to you about the importance of asking "why".

In life, we do alot of things without ever questioning it. breathe, eat, sleep, talk, etc. I mean why ever question things that simply just are? Its not going to change any of those things right? actually, wrong. When we question even the smallest and trivial things we are actually not only asking "why" but rather saying "I want to undertstand this better", which eventually might lead to someone going "now that I understand this, I want to improve it". Think about it, when we question why we breathe and then learn how we do it, now you have an understanding of how to improve it. Many activites like sports, working out, jogging, yoga and singing teaches you how to manage your oxygen intake and actually improve your abilities in that area! With physical activities if you breathe incorrectly, you wont be able to endure the stress being put on your body and in extreme cases might even cause yourself to asphyxiate because you arent managing your oxygen properly! With coding, its the exact same thing.

In coding, they're a dozens of things we have to learn all from a simple method to sinatra and above. When learning about these things at first, I'll be honest, I didn't question it. This was something brand new to me but I didnt question it, that was a mistake. As I breezed by many of the modules I came to a "wall". All of the sudden it hit me, I didn't actually know why I was doing some of the things I was doing.

What really is the difference between an instance method and a class method? Why do we need arguments for some methods and not for others? Why am I getting this specific error? I didnt start asking these questions until about a few weeks ago to be honest, I guess as an adult once you've been thrown to the wolves for nearly all your jobs, you just assume you'll get it. When I started a landscaping business with me and a few buddies, I didnt know how to landscape, I was told "do this, do that". Eventually I came to understand why I was doing the work I was doing but it definitely was alot of trial and error, trial and error I coudlve avoided if i just asked myself the simple question, "why?", I easily then coudlve went and tried to improve my understanding on the subject matter instead of fumbling and not caring.

To close this blog out, just remember to constantly question yourself, not out of doubt but rather out of self improvement! When our school work is done and its time to move on to our careers, I'd hope that we are all prepared to an extent. of course, life will throw its curve balls, no getting around that, but at least we can say "I did my best".
